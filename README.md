# Global-Blood-Group-Distribution-Analysis-

Did you know blood group distribution varies significantly across the world? Using data from 126 countries, we analyzed patterns and even built a predictive model for blood type prevalence!
🔍 Key Insights:
📊 O+ is the most common blood group globally (~38.4%), while AB- is the rarest.
🌎 Geography and genetics influence blood type distribution significantly.
📈 A linear regression model achieved an R² score of 0.975, accurately predicting O+ prevalence based on population and other blood types.
📌 Data Science Approach:
✅ Cleaned the dataset (removing commas, % symbols, handling missing values).
✅ Visualized blood type trends with heatmaps, histograms, and box plots.
✅ Built a predictive model to estimate blood group distribution across countries.
🚀 Next Steps:
🔹 Geospatial clustering for regional insights.
🔹 Advanced ML models for better accuracy.
🔹 Healthcare applications for emergency blood supply planning.
